For soleving a rubicks cube using DLS and limited BFS. 
Program Edited by Calvin Grant and Christian Carranza

Our sources: 
We got assistance from Rebecca and Troy. Rebecca explained some of the helper functions that we used and queued me into the "Testing the Reverse Action List Hypothesis" in the paper that was given to us by Dr. Lori.
Troy helped with some of the set up of our front tree which helped with the basis for the creation of our back tree. We also used chat.gpt and stackoverflow for learning the functions of a hashMap. 

The fileRubiksCubeMod is the file with the main code and our front (FTree) and back tree (BTree) and instance of the RubiksCube. The file requires the RubiksCube.java file from the other folder I have attached as well which also requires all other code from the paper as well. I was not able to attach all of the files from the orginal code (which I hope does not make it unable to run) 
The only alterations I made to the pre-exsisting code (the RubiksCube class) that is from the paper was the addition of the generateArry() method and the alteration to the depth of the randomize() function.
